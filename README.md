## Project Discription:

    This project is a multi-sectional landing page. Each section has some content. The navigation bar at the header of the page consists of list items with each section name, which when clicked it heads to the section whose name is the same as the clicked one. The section in viewport has an active class, which makes it more visible than other sections to clarify and increase focus.

## Usage:

My project is used as the home page of a website. Each section of the webpage has some content refering to the products or services the website offers, but for this project it is just filler paragraphs.


## Requirements:

1-Build the navigation menu dynamically using Javascript
2-Highlight the section in viewport
3-Items in the navbar should link to each corresponding section
4-The scrolling behavior should be smooth

### Additional requirements:
1-Add an active class to the navbar to show the section in viewport
2-Add a scroll-to-top button that appears only when the user crosses a specific instant in the page
3-Hide navigation menu when the page is stationary
4-Make the navigation menu responsive
